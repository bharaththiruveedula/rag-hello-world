# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Use this repository.... Instead of using JIRA rest api ... use python JIRA package as my enterprise JIRA is not working with direct API calls and use token_auth for authentication. Also, I see in relevant_files while processing repository is considering only type blob... but it needs to consider all recursive trees as well... like all subfolders... and ignore files under 1. config/ 2. files starting with watch/ 3. files starting with Dockerfile 4. files under playbook/ or handlers/"

        comment: "Verified that the JIRA integration now uses the Python JIRA package instead of direct REST calls. The code structure is correct with proper imports, client initialization, and error handling. The /api/test-connections endpoint correctly tests JIRA connection using jira_client.current_user() and the /api/jira-suggest endpoint uses jira_client.issue(). Both token_auth (primary) and basic_auth (fallback) paths are implemented correctly. Since we're using placeholder values in .env, we're seeing expected error responses with proper error handling."

        comment: "Verified that token authentication is correctly implemented as the primary authentication method with basic_auth as fallback. The JIRA client initialization in the startup event attempts token_auth first and falls back to basic_auth if token_auth fails and a username is provided. The same pattern is implemented in both test_jira_connection() and fetch_jira_ticket() functions. The auth_method is correctly reported in the API response when connection is successful."

        comment: "Updated fetch_repository_contents() function to process all recursive trees/subfolders instead of only immediate blob files. Added comprehensive filtering logic: 1) Excludes files under config/ directories, 2) Excludes files starting with 'watch', 3) Excludes files starting with 'Dockerfile', 4) Excludes files under playbook/ or handlers/ directories. Added pagination support for large repositories, better error handling for binary files, and detailed logging for debugging. The function now processes all directory trees recursively while applying the specified exclusion rules."

Since we're using placeholder values in .env, we're seeing expected error responses with proper error handling.
